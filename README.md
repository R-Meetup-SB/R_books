# Favorite R Books

We had a great discussion about our favorite R books and why do we still use books. 

To summarize our discussion, we settled on that although most of us use mainly Stackoverflow and other web ressources to seek information about specific problems and solutions, books are still a great ressource to lean on when we need to go more in depth into a specific topic. 

Here are the various books we discussed during our meeting:

### Computing Skills for Biologists: A Toolbox
By Stefano Allesina and Madlen Wilmes
https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13268.html
 
What Chris says:
- This book is like a toolbox
- Task oriented
- help to choose what tool to use to match the task you need to accomplish

What Ben says:
amazing ressources free, online and always up-to-date
Especially check out R for Data Science and Rmarkdown books!

### Advanced R
By Hadley Wickham 
https://adv-r.hadley.nz 

What Julien says:
Best for R users who starts to wonder why R does this? E.g. coercion: Why do I get a number when I use the sum function on TRUE/FALSE values?
Then “Foundations” section is a starting point
 
### Machine learning for dummies

What Bob says:
Give great examples in both Python and R
Covers the basics and also Image recognition

Great intro to basic regression analysis
Taking these courses help me to combine Psychometric packages with Rmarkdown for reporting purposes;
  
### Efficient programming in R
By Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace
https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/ 
 
What Tommy says:
a good reference to learn about R efficiency, although I wish there will be more advice on which data structures are the most efficient in R
